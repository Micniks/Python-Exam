Webscrabing:
Make a method that takes a string, and searches https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/ for that string, and returns the resulting text. Add Selenium, by using the searchbar, and selecting the right object from list.

Graphs & Nodes:
Show synergy between either feats, classes, or other, where the node-size is reletive to the amount of the class, and the edges thickness reletive to the amount that have both instances.

Data Manipulation:
Some data might be invalid, for instance characters with a total level over 20. Check the dataset for these, and remove the invalid.

Mashine Learning:
Use classification model to take ability scores, and output the most sutible class for that set of scores.

Datatable:
Display the data from the dataset in different ways to show reletive statistics and corralations.
